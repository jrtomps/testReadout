#  This establishes which version of NSCLDAQ we're using and where it's installed:
#  Supposedly  you only need to change this definition to update to a newer
#  version of the software:

INSTDIR=${DAQROOT}

include $(INSTDIR)/etc/SBSRdoMakeIncludes


#
#  The following allow you to add flags to all the default C and C++ compilation
#  rules.  In most cases C and C++ share the same set of compilation flags so:
#
#

USERCCFLAGS=
USERCXXFLAGS=$(USERCCFLAGS)

#  If you have additional load flags (e.g. library dirs and libs):

#USERLDFLAGS= -ldataformat -lefence
USERLDFLAGS= -ldataformat

#
#  This is a list of the objects that go into making the application
#  Make, in most cases will figure out how to build them:

OBJECTS=Skeleton.o CGeneratorSegment.o CMyScaler.o

Readout: $(OBJECTS)
	$(CXXLD) -o Readout $(OBJECTS) $(USERLDFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)

clean:  
	rm -f $(OBJECTS) Readout

depend:
	makedepend $(USERCXXFLAGS) *.cpp *.c 


help:
	echo make           - Build Readout.
	echo make clean     - Remove products from previous builds.
	echo make depend    - Add header dependencies to Makefile.
